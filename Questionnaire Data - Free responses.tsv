There wasn't room at the table for both the food and checklists, but presumably the astronauts would not have these checklists with them on actual missions.	Location near the food heater and utensil storage creates good kitchen management	Crew members might need the table to attach various items to in order to keep track of them	A location nearer to the table would be preferred	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	All seemed to be in a good location and near to each other except the food storage, which was located elsewhere nowhere near the table	Location of all important elements clustered together	Panel was not overcrowded with each space clearly labeled	Would be better to make personal calls in each crew member's quarters	See above	-888	it makes sense to have the storage area out of the way of other crew activities	-888	Panels near science lab worked well for payload functionality	The workspace definitely had enough space to carry out the activities	The science section was well placed out of the way	No interference	More than enough space	Access ok yet out of the way, did not interfere	more than enough space	somewhat in the way of the cargo module	more than enough space	once the hatch was closed, more than enough privacy	see above	close proximity to CO2 scrubber made it very easy	far from other crew members allowed uninterrupted work	a little hard to take out but otherwise acceptable	no effect	close to other systems but out of the way	out of the way	took very little effort	-888	out of the way, did not interfere	a 3rd helper might be beneficial	see above	more than enough space for each crew member	more than enough space for each crew member	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	There were no obstructions between the emergency path and the Orion spacecraft, it would be better if the emergency panel was closer to Orion	Depends on what the crew is doing at the moment the emergency occurs.	Good but not perfect; better placement of table might be beneficial along with changes to crew quarters to make them more private	Enough space but some windows would be nice	More than enough space for all activities	Some common leisure space could be beneficial	-999	-999	the node could be smaller	crew spaces could be a bit larger	add places to crew quarters to hang personal items	No	No	-999	-999	-999	-999	Windows, small ones in crew quarters if possible

Still workable, though.	Clustered as in one part of the habitat, or without privacy dividers? I think after 60 days any small amount of privacy would be welcome, so I'll say "spread out around the habitat"	would be more private if they were spread out - but the astronauts would know what they signed up for	-888	-888	For someone 6'2"m it's a bit short (especially in microgravity)	Had no problems with this	-888	-888	Perhaps it could be built into the roof of the sleeping quarter? Fine where it is	HAB-S-3-B (science bench) protrudes into the table area, restricting one crew member's use of the table	Minor note: procedure says "water heater pump on", while there are two switches; "water heater" and "water pump". Also, the "water counter" knob turns counter-clockwise -- this seems counter-intuitive	Needed room to move around more than a workspace for this scenario	No problems here	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	Could move food storage to HAB-S-4-A, and perhaps trash to a location accessible to all four crew members while they are at the table (under the table? Velcro to roof? trash part in wall below oven?)	-888	Kind of tight for 4 people standing around it	No privacy; would rather Skype in crew quarters/airlock	As above	Need to complete cargo transfer before the other crew member closes the hatch to take a bath (or wait until they are done)	Somewhat blocked by the EVA suits and resistive exercise device; have to bend down to pick stuff up (in Earth gravity)	The GAP was not near the science bench; otherwise OK	A little low for a tall guy like me; had to bend down to read panel/properly adjust water knob (which turns opposite the other water knob)	The top part, which overhangs the bench was too low for a person my height	was not interrupted by other crew activity	not at all	no problems here	no problems	-888	somewhat blocked by storage closet	vertical pipe was in the way for changing clothes, but perhaps it would not be there in reality	-888	private as long as hatch is closed - hopefully other crew doesn't need to get in there	-888	-888	had to tilt them in order to get them into this space	not at all	is this a duplicate question from the prior page?	-888	resistive exerciser was heavy/bulky	resistive exerciser was the only challenge	seemed fine, except that the umbilical was too short	-999	-999	-999	-999	no problems	I think 2 per EVA astronaut would be too crowded	A little tight, but not bad if you spread out - maybe have the suits on 2 separate stands	same as above	put the suits on 2 separate stands, apart from one another	Nothing in our way - the table would have been in the way if it were up	The emergency cue card said "if < 0.85 mmHg, then..." and "if > 0.85 mmHg, then evacuate," but you still needed to turn off the "main power" (which was labeled daytime power). Also, this decision should be a flowchart.	Table slightly blocked by science bench. Node/habitat hatch a little small.	It's small, but usable and anyone in there would knew what they were signing up for	This was plenty large for everything we had to do	ceiling a little low for a 6'2" astronaut, especially in microgravity	-999	-999	The node - though I imagine that in reality, more tasks would happen here (bring in hardware from EVA, etc.)	perhaps a little more headroom in the sleeping area	My storage space was near the science bench, so the storage area on the opposite side of the sleeping quarters seemed useless to me - no reason for me to go over there	unplugging the science payload power wires without switching the power off seemed like a fire hazard	No, I don't think that would be necessary	-999	-999	-999	-999	-888

Because of gravity acting, it's not easy to feel its real size in 3D space.	Closely clustered, even though that goes against privacy. The team spirit is encouraged.	The sleeping quarters are just for sleeping. Their size is just fine. It feels like sleeping in a tent.	-888	-888	Because of my height, it's not easy to answer this question.	-888	-888	-888	It is a little far away from my sleeping quarter.	A little far away from my sleeping quarter.	-888	-888	-888	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	The table and oven seem to be in the right locations. Just in the middle, accessible to all the crew. Same with the rehydration system. The waste bag is only accessible to one of the members. Maybe the food storage can be on top (or bottom) of the oven?	-888	It's almost at the center of the habitat, and thus accessible to all the crew.	-888	It's better to have some kind of privacy for personal communication.	The path to the cargo transfer was completely clear.	-888	Why is the GAP not in the science workstation?	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	Could be stored on different shelves so things are not easily confused.	-888	-888	-888	Don't know how much effort is required in microgravity.	-888	-888	-999	-999	-999	-999	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	The path is clear and direct. There are no corners and no turning needed.	As I said, it should be easy to egress.	I think there's room for 2 crew of 4 to move reasonably.	No problem with sleeping in a small room, with all the crew clustered together. For me, it's like sleeping in a tent. However, some people might have concerns regarding privacy.	There's enough room for exercising, EVA-related activities, and cleaning.	-888	-999	-999	n	n	n	The node item removal.	n	-999	-999	-999	-999	Love it!

Closely clustered so that the area is designated for sleeping, and people know when others are sleeping.	The curtain does a good job.	The area is pretty small, but if all your doing is sleeping than it is alright.	You don't need that much space.	The height is totally sufficient.	The width is a little tight.	They do not get in the way at all.	It is always available, wherever you are.	It would be a good idea to have the personal hygiene utilities inside the sleeping quarters.	With all four people, the area was a little small, but completely manageable.	It is good that it is right next to the table.	-888	It is in a good location.	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	They are all accessible. The waste basket could be under the table.	A little tight when shoulder to shoulder.	In good position for everyone to see.	Easy for user.	-888	They weren't in the way that much.	It is in a very good location.	Perfect location.	Good location.	Plenty of space.	Good location.	They weren't in the way.	plenty of space	perfect location	perfect space	great location	plenty of volume	greatly private	Only issue is that 1 person can use it at a time.

The table was too small	Didn't mind heating up everyone's meals and getting silverware for them, but the table could be centered right below the food warmer for more efficient cooking.	If there is a table available for other uses throughout the day, it would begin to feel cramped.	-888	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	Everything was in close proximity to one another which was good. Centering the table more towards being underneath the oven may make it easier to reach from the table. This problem could also be solved by being in microgravity (i.e. it will be easier to reach over if you aren't planted on the ground.)	-888	-888	Not much privacy for personal phone calls; possibly consider making phone calls accessible from personal laptops instead.	-888	Couldn't put bag back efficiently since there was someone in the shower. Other than this, there were no problems.	-888	-888	-888	Had good amount of room to conduct experiments without getting in other crew member's way.	-888	Couldn't put back experiment since someone was showering, but other than that there were no problems.	Treadmill width is good, length could be a little longer for taller people.	-888	Felt a little squished against the wall, microgravity could probably fix this problem.	-888	Consider making space a little bigger to have a place to store clothes.	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	It was a little difficult to put on suits, but would probably be easier is the suits were fitted.	-888	-888	-888	More than one person per crew member may be chaotic.	-888	-888	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	Was big enough for everyone to quickly exit, but if the table is out and other things are being stowed, there may become obstacles to the exit.	The only thing that slowed our crew down was that we were unsure of whether or not we completed everything before exiting. With training, all 4 people could exit within a minute.	Every place overall had enough room to work, especially when microgravity will be in effect.	Overall there was enough space for 4 people. One more person would have made the space too crowded.	With microgravity effect, there is a reasonable amount of room for crewmembers.	The habitat seems to be where most of the day is spent, so it could be a little larger.	-999	-999	Some storage units were bigger than was needed.	Habitat needs more space for how much time is spent in the area.	Only layout I would change would be arrangement of sleeping quarters to have more privacy.	n	Spatial dividers only seem necessary in sleeping quarters and the shower for privacy.	-999	-999	-999	-999	Overall, very good set up! Minor tweaks will make the habitat even better.

If the mission were longer, it'd be nice to have more volume.	It would make getting ready a bit less cramped.	It is fine for short term, but over a long period of time it might be nice to have more than just a curtain.	I had enough space to maneuver. I could have used some micro-g though.	I like to have space to move around while brushing my teeth but that's just me	I'm not very tall so I didn't have any issues with the height of the sleeping quarter.	It was wide enough for one person. If you want more than that able to pass though it gets a bit cramped.	It wasn't bad sleeping near my other crew members.	Having my hygiene cabinet nearby is nice, but maybe being able to store it in my sleeping quarters would help me do things quicker.	Plenty of space for my items but it was inconvenient to have to go outside of my quarters to access the cabinet	The table space was just enough to store all of my food, utensils, and drinks. It got a bit crowded with all of the food.	It's not at all convenient to have to reach across the table to heat up the food and dispense water.	It creates more space, especially for activities by the command center.	It felt like food was stored far away from the galley.	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	The table was great, especially because it was collapsible. The oven, waste bag, and rehydration were hard to reach. Food storage was far away.	It was hard to find buttons the first time, but that's the case with any interface.	With the table collapsed there wasn't much issue getting everyone around it.	It might be nice to have it be in private, especially for family communication.	-888	No issues with getting my bag.	-888	Everything was where it should be.	It would be nice to have it be more centralized or have more permanent payload locations.	Tons of area to work on science or other things	Same as above.	-888	It seemed adequate though an actual treadmill might feel different.	Why is the treadmill in the node? It seems weird to have to move it for EVAs	There was plenty of space to workout	There seems to be a lot of volume in the node for activities.	-888	With an actual hatch, I'd be fine bathing in there.	Same as above.	-888	-888	The LiOH system works great!	-888	-888	Its nice having a whole space dedicated to EVA.	Not a problem. A bit inconvenient, but not the end of the world.	-888	-888	It's nice to have the person to help out with putting on pieces.	I think more might get a bit too chaotic.	Plenty of space in the node	-888	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	It seemed like there was enough space.	With training, they could definitely do it. It was hard to read the cue card and actually figure out what was going on, because all of the scenarios looked similar. A bigger card or a designated procedure sheet might be helpful.	I think there could be some changes in layout to more efficiently use some of the space, especially for the node.	It would probably be pushing it at 60 days. A bit more space would help, especially since the habitat would be pretty packed with 60 days worth of equipment.	There is so much volume in the node, using that for storage would probably help a lot.	The habitable volume was good but did get a bit cramped at mealtime and in the morning.	-999	-999	The node seemed empty compared to the rest of the hab.	More volume in the crew area would be nice, especially for a long term mission	I would put the food by the galley. And maybe have two food warmers in each side of the table.	n	Spatial dividers would definitely make it feel more cramped and take away from the open-ness. The habitat was more open than I expected it to be.	-999	-999	-999	-999	It was fun! Working microphones and stuff would be really cool.

I would change the shower location to not be where the storage area is or somewhere not in the node because if someone is showering no-one can use the node	The only time that felt like a task could be unsafe is transferring exercise equipment for EVA procedure because it's large and the hole is small	Spatial dividers would make me feel like there was less volume, especially in the habitat.

This doesn't matter to me too much, but it would be nice to have everyone nearby so the full crew is always accounted for.	While we were physically seperated we could still hear eachother clearly, which will get annoying. Hearing other people breath could get annoying.

As someone that is 6' 4", I need my space to fully stretch out, something I couldn't quite do inside.	It's very crowded that doesn't allow for more than one person to stand in at a time.	If the rooms were more sound proof that would be a good thing.	No complaints here.	-888	Quite crowded but doable	We would have to reach over everyone's food to prepare our own.

That would make washing and brushing difficult. Need some space around laptop to maneuver.	Good for a person of my height	Fine, but forces one-at-a-time entrance, which can make doing simultaneous tasks between rooms difficult	Okay, might like a bit more distance from quarters across from me	I think it's great for a small habitat	Nice and closer to sleeping quarters.

Privacy is important for those times since you live in such close proximity with your crew mates.	-888	I could foresee an issue with working out right there, but in microgravity it could be configured better.	-888	-888	-888	-888	If table was set up, this could be an issue.	Seems unrealistic, hard to image actual bulk	-888	-888	-888	Almost too much room, feels very open	Same as above	Seems unlikely to be able to close off entire node for that length of time	-888	-888	-888	-888	Should this take up such valuable work area?	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	Given the space, this was adequate room	More than 1 would be crowded/a hassle	-999	-999	-999	Clear path, easy to navigate so long as table is down	We could cut 80 seconds if I knew exactly the dp/dt rate that was acceptable.	If the hallway in the sleeping station area were a tad wider, this would be a 6	This would get cramped, but would be acceptable	Huge! Lots of room -> Any way to utilize better?	Good amount of work space for a good number of days, for a longer duration mission, This would be fine for 2 crew members	-999	-999	The node	The hallway	I would consider separating the sleeping stations in groups of two with some room for hygiene between?	No	No, having personal space is nice, but working as a team is great.	-999	-999	-999	-999	I think it could be worthwhile to assess the layout of the sleeping quarters and add a couple inches to the hallway.

A little close together, besides that it is fine.	This is space, save mass.	Slightly cramped.	I am short	perfectly fine	all in one convenient location	everything is pretty close	a little cramped, retrieve one at a time.	utensil storage is a little hard to get to.	keep it next to table	you need room	distance is good maybe keep utensils here	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	this set up for dining is good, might take some getting used to but it keeps everything manageable and convenient.	good location	everything is laid out in a way that is easy to find.	might not have the privacy some people would want for personal communication	privacy is nice in such close quarters	made it a little weird to enter and leave node.	put it near crew members	keep utensils close for astronaut work	keep it close	seems like adequate room to work for this science	seemed out of the way even though it was in the middle	toward the end everyone piles in but besides that its fine	doesn't need more space for a stationary device	seems a little close to entrance for the habitat	Does not need more space	does not seem like its in the way	should not need more room for a sponge bath	seems fine and accessible, new rags?	seems close to habitat, but is overall fine	keep it right next to the station	right next to station is nice	It is nice to remove and set down. Why keep spent trash in the habitat though?	Never in the way	It seems directly in the middle but is not in the way	keep that in the node	It might get cramped with a real treadmill and exercise center	it worked fine, same concern as before	I would not put the panel anywhere else	enough room in the node	only need one	seems to take long for untrained members	there was enough room	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	straight paths are good, keep it orderly.	With training, most of our time was reading the checklist and figuring out what to do.	It was good, seemed like the crew quarters were a little tight	It was good, seemed like the crew quarters were a little tight	Does not seem to be larger if equipment is the same size	Crew quarters are a little tight	-999	-999	Overall living space	Crew quarters and hallways	n	n	slightly for individual crew cabins nothing else	-999	-999	-999	-999	yes, windows, absolutely necessary. Isolation without recongizing the outside universe is bad for psychological health.

I would rather have it closer to the table and food warmer.	-999	-999	-999	-999	-999	I would prefer everything to be closer, probably shifted to the sleeping quarters. Table, oven and waste bag are all well collocated.	Need some time for getting used to the layout.	Can be busy when operated by four persons	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	-888	I would replace science station location with the table location.

As a test group we had too many issues with understanding instructions and going through them.	I would consider moving walls in habitat area.	The volume is ok and a crew of four wouldn't have main issues. The part of the habitat where personal items of crew member 3 and crew member 4 looks like it is not used well enough. That is, probably there is a room for something else in addition.	The node is roomy, maybe even too much.	Completely acceptable. (Maybe I would consider smaller table.)	-999	-999	The node	n	yes, as already mentioned, I would move science center closer to the science panel and the node.	n	n	-999	-999	-999	-999	-888
